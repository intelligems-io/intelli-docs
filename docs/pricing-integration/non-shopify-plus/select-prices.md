# 3. Select Prices

The Intelligems app requires that all product `price` and `compare-at-price` locations be tagged. These tags allow the
app to dynamically modify the price per test group. You can tag your store's prices using the Intelligems 
Integration widget or by manually editing your theme. Learn how to tag your prices [here](../update-your-theme.md).
After tagging all your store's prices, continue to the next step of the integration.
