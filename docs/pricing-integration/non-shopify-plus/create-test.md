# 2. Create A Test

Go to the Intelligems App and press `Create New Experiment` and choose `Pricing Experiment`.

Go through the creation flow and finish creating your test. 
After you create your test, Intelligems generates duplicate products in your Shopify store in order to display 
the correct test group price. Intelligems generated products will be tagged with `price_test`. These products will be 
deleted when you end your experiment. 

:::info
Intelligems uses product duplication to run price tests on Non-Shopify Plus stores. Not an option for you? Contact
