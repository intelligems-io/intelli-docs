# 6. Complete Your Integration

After you have completed all previous integration steps, go through your store and make sure everything looks correct.

Recommended Places to Check:
1. View PDPs of products in the test and not in the test. Make sure prices are correctly updating when switching the
test group in the Intelligems Widget.
2. Add products to your cart and make sure the price is correct and no Intelligems discount message it showing.

Once you have verified Intelligems is fully integrated, you can start your test from the Intelligems App!
