# Price Tests with Intelligems

Many companies determine pricing using a ‚Äúfinger-in-the-wind‚Äù approach - maybe checking some competitors, and working
backwards from a margin target. But this doesn‚Äôt tell you about how the price affects your customers‚Äô decisions about
whether to buy the product!

At Intelligems, we believe that the only way to really know this is through experimentation & testing, and gathering
real data about how price affects your customers‚Äô behavior.

This doc will walk you through how to test pricing with Intelligems, and some best practices to keep in mind.

## How to Run Price Tests with Intelligems:

### Setting up your test groups

1. Click ‚ÄòCreate New Experiment‚Äô at the top-left of the Intelligems app page

1. Fill in the Name and Description of the Experiment you wish to create

    <aside>
    üí° Put some detail in the description! Tests can be live for several weeks, and people do sometimes forget how they set things up :)

2. Create as many groups as you would like to include in the test by clicking on the ‚Äò+ Group‚Äô icon

    <aside>
    üí° The more groups you have, the longer it will take to get statically significant results. You‚Äôll need > 100-200 orders *for each group* in the test to be confident

1. Name the groups for the experiment and use the slider to allocate what percentage of traffic will go to each group.
   Click ‚ÄòContinue‚Äô when you are done.

    <aside>
    üí° Splits will default to even among the groups, but some users prefer to allocate more traffic to the control group

### Picking the products for your tests

1. On the next page, select which products will be price-tested by ticking the boxes to the left of the products. If you
   wish to test changes to all products, use the select all box at the top-left of the table. Click ‚ÄòContinue‚Äô when you
   have selected all products you want to include in the test

    <aside>
    üí° The menu should include *all* products from your store. If you see anything missing - or if you have *too many* options and want to send us the products manually, reach out to support@intelligems.io

### Setting the prices that you want to test

1. On the ‚ÄòSet Test Group Prices‚Äô page, use either the ‚ÄòQuick Set‚Äô or ‚ÄòManual Set‚Äô option to set the prices for your
   tests.
    1. **Quick Set:** Set the percentages or dollar amount changes you would like to incorporate in the test groups. Use
       negatives (-) to reflect price decreases and use the drop-down menus on the right to toggle between percentage
       changes (%) and dollar amount changes ($)

    2. **Manual Set:** To enable Manual Set, toggle the switch on the upper-left of the screen. Click ‚ÄòDownload Template
       CSV‚Äô to download the sheet where you will manually enter the prices for the test group.

       ![Screen Shot 2022-01-06 at 11.54.42 AM.png](/img/price-testing/Screen_Shot_2022-01-06_at_11.54.42_AM.png)

The spreadsheet will allow you to set prices for each product variant within each test group. Using Excel, Google
Sheets, Numbers, or another csv editing tool, manually input the prices for the test groups and save the file with a
.csv extension.

Back on the Intelligms app, click ‚ÄòUpload CSV‚Äô and select the saved csv file.

Once you are done with the Quick Set or Manual Set process, click ‚ÄòCreate Experiment‚Äô.
